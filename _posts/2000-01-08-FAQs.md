# Are you official?

### No

------------------------

# What are your sources? How is the data gathered for this project?

### I use the offical posters published by the Chennai corporation and collect in a database which i have made freely available on the site. 

------------------------

# Who are you?

### A common man like everyone else.

------------------------

# Why are you putting in time and resources to do this and not making fame or money for yourself?

### I love my city and moreover this affects everyone in the city. 

### Like all corona warriors fighting this pandemic I like to be anonymous since this is a collective effort and cant be credited to a single person. Please donate anything you can afford to the corona warriors in your locality.

### I strongly believe in open data and would love if people understood the overall trends with easily readable graphs and come up with ways for intrepreting it, instead of it being locked up in daily posters. A well informed citizenary is essential to a democracy.

------------------------

# How accurate are the map and statistics?

### I strive for accuracy, but errors are bound to happen. Users are kindly requested to report any errors on my twitter or telegram and I will fix them.     

------------------------

# Will you be collabrating with the GCC?

### I would love to, but unfortunately was blocked by them for warning fellow citizens of the privacy policy issues with GCC corona monitoring app. I was even accused spreading 'fake news' and spreading 'false propaganda' that will make people 'panic'. Nevertheless I have notified the developers and they are rectifying it.
