# Are you official?

### No

------------------------

# What are your sources? How is the data gathered for this project?

### The daily posters published by the Greater Chennai Corporation is the primary source which I have compiled in a <a href= "https://elseasama.github.io/covid19chennai/#database">database</a> and has been made avaiable for everyone. Reports from fellow concerned citizens and journalists are also used after vetting for validity. 
### For the full list of sources, plese check the sources sheet of the <a href= "https://elseasama.github.io/covid19chennai/#database">database</a> file.

# Who are you?

### A common man like everyone else.

------------------------

# Why are you putting in time and resources to do this and not making fame or money for yourself?
> "The darkest night is ignorance." - **Gautama Buddha**

### Because I love my city and moreover this affects everyone in the city and a well informed citizenry is essential to a democracy.

### Like all corona warriors fighting this pandemic I like to be anonymous since this is a collective effort and cant be credited to a single person. Please donate anything you can afford to the corona warriors in your locality.

### I strongly believe in open data and would love if people understood the overall trends with easily readable graphs and gauge the response need to prevent further spread of the disease, instead of it all being locked up in daily posters.

------------------------

# How accurate are the map and statistics?

### I strive for accuracy, but errors are bound to happen. Users are kindly requested to report any errors on my <a href= "https://elseasama.github.io/covid19chennai/#contactme">twitter</a> or <a href="https://elseasama.github.io/covid19chennai/#contactme"> telegram</a> accounts.

------------------------

# What tools are you using to make the maps and graphs?

### For the **maps** I use [Qgis](https://qgis.org/en/site/ "Qgis- V3.12.2"). You can find the shape files for Chennai and the Qgis project files [here](https://github.com/elseasama/covid19chennai/tree/gh-pages/chennai_data). Highly recommend this tutorial [site](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/) by [Ujval Gandhi](https://twitter.com/spatialthoughts) to learn how to make your own maps!

### For the **graphs** I use [Google sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).



------------------------

# Why are you not collaborating with the Greater Chennai Corporation?

### I would love to, but unfortunately was blocked by them for warning fellow citizens of the privacy policy issues with GCC corona monitoring app. I was eventually accused of spreading 'fake news' and 'false propaganda' with the intention to create 'panic' amongst the people. Nevertheless I have notified the developers and they are rectifying it.
